# RomanNameGenerator

I have been working on a web-based gladiator game and needed to generate roman names. I ended up pulling this gem out of the app at the request of a few friends who apparently, wanted a roman name!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'roman-name-generator'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install roman-name-generator

## Usage

full_name = RomanNameGenerator.Generator.new("male").result
